        <p> <b>Abstract:</b> 
        This paper examines the interactions between large incumbent firms and new entrants on innovation decisions in the context of the 2008 financial crisis. I posit that there was an asymmetric effect of the crisis on firm access to financing which increased the opportunity for financial flows between firms. Mergers and acquisitions are one type of financial flow with well documented data that I suggest became more likely during this period. With an increased likelihood of being bought out, I investigate whether new entrants began innovating "closer" to their potential acquirers to further increase their chances of a buyout."Closeness" in terms of innovation is hard to characterize. I will present results with different measures that have been used in the prior literature and their different interpretations. We indeed find that higher expectations of buyout result in less original innovation in entrants.

      <p>
        <b>Abstract: </b>As environmental issues become increasingly addressed globally, the question of whether there are strategic incentives to regulation becomes more and more relevant. Here we study the case of vehicle emissions regulations and provide evidence that there are decreasing returns to late regulation implementation. Vehicle emission regulations are adopted in a large set of countries, they undergo multiple levels of stringency and are relatively comparable between countries; as such, they provide a good setting to study this question. Through the use of patent data we build innovation indicators as well as proxies for regulation specific market sizes at the firm level. These are used to investigate the push and pull dynamics of innovation creation. Additionally, different emissions control technologies are addressed individually and surprisingly, despite their different characteristics, give similar results.
