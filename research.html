        Buyouts and Innovation Incentives: The Case of the Great Recession  </li>
        <p> <b>Abstract:</b> 
        This paper examines the interactions between large incumbent firms and new entrants on innovation decisions in the context of the 2008 financial crisis. I posit that there was an asymmetric effect of the crisis on firm access to financing which increased the opportunity for financial flows between firms. Mergers and acquisitions are one type of financial flow with well documented data that I suggest became more likely during this period. With an increased likelihood of being bought out, I investigate whether new entrants began innovating "closer" to their potential acquirers to further increase their chances of a buyout."Closeness" in terms of innovation is hard to characterize. I will present results with different measures that have been used in the prior literature and their different interpretations. We indeed find that higher expectations of buyout result in less original innovation in entrants.

        Regulation Timing on Green Innovation: The Case of Vehicle Emissions , joint with Antoine Dechezlepretre and Matthieu Glachant</li>
      <p>
        <b>Abstract: </b>As environmental issues become increasingly addressed globally, the question of whether there are strategic incentives to regulation becomes more and more relevant. Here we study the case of vehicle emissions regulations and provide evidence that there are decreasing returns to late regulation implementation. Vehicle emission regulations are adopted in a large set of countries, they undergo multiple levels of stringency and are relatively comparable between countries; as such, they provide a good setting to study this question. Through the use of patent data we build innovation indicators as well as proxies for regulation specific market sizes at the firm level. These are used to investigate the push and pull dynamics of innovation creation. Additionally, different emissions control technologies are addressed individually and surprisingly, despite their different characteristics, give similar results.

      <li> Firm R&D Inertia</li>
      <p> <b> Abstract: </b> 
        Firm R&D decisions are likely to have lasting consequences. However this has not been documented in terms of firms' technological position. This paper introduces the concept of firm inertia and presents some patterns about it over the life cycle. Using patent data, I build a measure to compare the similarity between an innovative firm's technological contents over time with its technological position when it enters. I find that new entrants are likely to continue patenting in areas similar to their initial invention for multiple years. Given that on the aggregate, firms experience inertia, I then describe how the degree of inertia is affected by initial conditions. I find that the initial originality of the firm negatively affects the inertial tendencies of the firm while having previous experience in R&D exerts a positive effect on firm inertia. The heterogeneous firm size distribution is also explored as is the effect of technology sector concentration.

        The vast trove of data now available on the internet prompts the question of how best to access that data. Hence search engine algorithms are highly valued...
