          Buyouts and Innovation Incentives: The Case of the Great Recession  </li>
        <p> <b>Abstract:</b> 
        This paper examines the interactions between large incumbent firms and new entrants on innovation decisions in the context of the 2008 financial crisis. I use the asymmetric effect of the crisis on firm access to financing between new firms and large firms to infer a likelihood of getting bought out for a new firm. In particular, I investigate how an increase in the likelihood of a new entrant getting acquired affects their innovation choices with respect to the existing firms. I construct a novel measure of innovation proximity and show that this leads new firms to innovate "closer" to their potential acquirers.

        Regulation Timing on Green Innovation: The Case of Vehicle Emissions, joint with Antoine Dechezlepretre and Matthieu Glachant</li>
      <p>
        <b>Abstract: </b>Are there strategic incentives to environmental regulation? Here we study the case of vehicle emissions regulations and provide evidence that there are decreasing returns to late regulation implementation. Vehicle emission regulations are adopted in a large set of countries, they undergo multiple levels of stringency and are relatively comparable between countries; as such, they provide a good setting to study this question. Through the use of patent data we build innovation indicators as well as proxies for regulation specific market sizes at the firm level. These are used to investigate the push and pull dynamics of innovation creation. Additionally, different emissions control technologies are addressed individually and surprisingly, despite their different characteristics, give similar results.

      <li> Firm R&D Inertia</li>
      <p> <b> Abstract: </b> 
        Firm R&D decisions are likely to have lasting consequences. However this has not been documented in terms of firms' technological position. This paper introduces the concept of firm inertia and presents some patterns about it over the life cycle. Using patent data, I build a measure to compare the similarity between an innovative firm's technological contents over time with its technological position when it enters. I find that new entrants are likely to continue patenting in areas similar to their initial invention for multiple years. Given that on the aggregate, firms experience inertia, I then describe how the degree of inertia is affected by initial conditions. I find that the initial originality of the firm negatively affects the inertial tendencies of the firm while having previous experience in R&D exerts a positive effect on firm inertia. The heterogeneous firm size distribution is also explored as is the effect of technology sector concentration.

      <li> Has the nature of competition changed due to e-commerce? </li>
      
      <p> <b> Abstract: </b> 
        The internet has been praised for lowering barriers to entry, ... 
        However it has also brought fundamental changes to how our economy functions. The rising use of e-commerce is the focus of this study. A major difference between the online and offline shopping experience is that the online platform can control what you see and can tailor it to each user. This puts much more power in the hands of the platform and highlights the importance of search algorithms. Behavioral studies have shown that users rarely look past the first page even if there were the same products being sold at a lower price on a later page. As such, I posit that online retailers now primarily compete for a top ranking in the search algorithm and this only includes price as one of many factors, such as number of historical sales, reviews, etc. 
        This helps build a measure for the power of platforms through their search algorithms. 
        This study also adds a dimension to competition that might not have been elaborated before: the search term that users input at the start of their search. I suggest that this pushes firms to develop more niche products inorder to avoid close competition from others.  

<!--
        As more and more products are being sold online,

        The vast trove of data now available on the internet prompts the question of how best to access that data. Hence search engine algorithms are highly valued...
