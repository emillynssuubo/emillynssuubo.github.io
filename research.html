          Buyouts and Startup Innovation Incentives </li>
        <p> <b>Abstract:</b> 
            This paper investigates how start-up innovation choices are affected by incumbent firm interactions. In particular, incumbent firms have an impact on start-up exit strategies as they can affect their expectations of getting acquired, of success, or of going bankrupt. Using the asymmetric effect of the 2008 financial crisis on firm access to financing between new entrants and incumbents, I infer a likelihood of getting bought out for entrants. I then estimate how an increase in the expectation of getting acquired affects a new firm's innovation choices with respect to the existing firms. I construct a novel measure of innovation proximity and show that new firms innovate “closer” to their potential acquirers.
